This directory contains a prepatched cross-compiler and toolchain for
use with OS/161 and/or System/161.

This consists of the following files:

cs161-binutils-1.5.tgz		Linker/assembler/tools.
cs161-gcc-1.5.tgz		C compiler.
cs161-gdb-1.5.tgz		Debugger.

These tools are suitable for use with System/161 1.14 and up, and
OS/161 1.10 and up. (Older versions may require the older toolchains
found in the "old" directory.)

They are based on the following GNU releases:

   binutils:	binutils-2.17
   gcc:		gcc-4.1.2
   gdb:		gdb-6.6

They have been repackaged for easy installation and use by our
students.

Note that you must install binutils before gcc.


Patches
-------

Binutils is unchanged.

gcc has a small patch to provide STABS line number info for assembler
source files.

gdb has two patches, which together allow remote debugging over
AF_UNIX sockets, which allows it to talk to System/161.

The patches alone may be fetched from the "patches" directory. You
don't need these if you download the whole archives.


Platforms/support
-----------------

The following platforms are believed to work. Those where it has been
explicitly tested so far are marked with an asterisk.

	(*) i386-netbsd
	    i386-freebsd
	    i386-openbsd
	    i386-linux
	    alpha-osf1
	    sparc-solaris
	    powerpc-darwin (MacOS X)

Theoretically, any other platform the FSF tools support ought to work.
Positive or negative reports (or patches) are welcome.
